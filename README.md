# Potential talks/speakers

* **Graphql** - I know Marc is investigating it at Photocrowd and I've played with it a tiny bit (suggested by Ian)
* **Documentation** - Stuff like sphinx, readthedocs, writethedocs, documentation driven development. Cory mentioned sphinx in a recent talk - he might be a good person to ask, either to give a talk or to advise on other speakers (suggested by Ian)
* **Package maintainership** - something like Matt Westcott from Torchbox a talking about lessons from maintaining Wagtail, release cycles, issue triaging, api stability etc (suggested by Craig)
