# Speaker checklist

Things to think about if you're looking after the speaker.

* [ ] Give them your phone number in case of any issues
* [ ] Let them know the format of the event; how long their slot is and how long they have for questions.
* [ ] How will they be travelling to the event, do they need to park?
* [ ] How far are they coming, do they need accommodation sorting?
* [ ] Tell them when the event set up starts and offer to meet them for dinner before hand.
* [ ] Do they need any equipment, e.g., VGA/HDMI adapter
